# Future Work

The following activities and features are planned for in the next 12 months:

- Provide an enhanced search UI in Teleseer for executing more complex Splunk and Elasticsearch queries.  This UI will allow a user to save searches, edit them and provide more screen space for query composition.
  
- Provide introspection visibility from Teleseer into which indexes are available in Splunk and Elasticsearch for querying by Teleseer. This will include an ability to filter by source indexes that overlap (in time) with the current Teleseer project.
  
- Provide an ability to overlay many Splunk or Elasticsearch queries within the same Teleseer project as "feeds".  Each feed will be an independent search and can be used to stream in many different Splunk and Elasticsearch indexes.  Teleseer visualization controls will allow the user to toggle these various feeds on and off (as overlays), as well as search within independent tags across each independent Splunk and Elasticsearch feed overlay.
  
- Add Teleseer permalinks to Teleflow to facilitate pivoting from teleflow indices in Splunk and Elasticsearch back into Teleseer.   This will provide a "where is this asset?" and "what is this asset?" visualization capability in Splunk and Elasticsearch.

- Add Teleseer analytic and alert outputs to Teleflow.
