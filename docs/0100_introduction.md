# Introduction

##  Purpose

In an era where cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, a proper cyber defense strategy demands organizations employ multiple tools to monitor, analyze, and respond to potential risks. This allows tools to complement each other, addressing gaps in capabilities, user training and in operation execution.  The ability to seamlessly integrate and interoperate these tools is critical to achieving a holistic view of the network and ensuring timely detection and mitigation of threats. This document outlines the successful demonstration of a ***Teleseer Interoperability Test*** with the Government’s hunt kit software loadset, specifically focusing on Teleseer's integrations with **Splunk** and **Elasticsearch**, two important tools used by US Cyber Mission Forces.

This report provides a detailed overview of the integration process, the functionality of the tools involved, and discussion of potential usescases and capabilities afforded by the integration Teleseer, Splunk, and Elasticearch. The goal of this project was a proof-of-concept (POC) to ensure that Teleseer effectively ingests and processes data from Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, enabling enhanced visibility and actionable insights for cybersecurity operations.

The interoperability test described in this document was performed in accordance with the requirements outlined in Section 2.1.6 of the contract.

## Teleseer

Teleseer is a network telemetry analysis platform designed to process, visualize, and analyze vast amounts of network data in real time. It enables cybersecurity teams to build detailed network topologies, uncover hidden threat patterns, and correlate data from multiple sources. Key features of Teleseer include:

1. **PCAP Ingestion and Analysis**: Teleseer processes packet capture (PCAP) files to generate insights into network activities.
2. **Real-Time Capture**: Teleseer supports real-time packet capture and telemetry ingestion (config files, logs, etc), allowing for dynamic updates to network maps and topology views.
3. **Integration with External Tools**: Teleseer integrates with platforms like Splunk and Elasticsearch to enhance its data visualization and correlation capabilities.
4. **Timeline Visualization**: Interactive timelines provide a visual representation of events, helping analysts correlate activities across different timeframes.

Teleseer’s primary value lies in its ability to ingest data from multiple formats and sources and produce an interactive, unified visual model of a netowrk.  This makes it an essential tool for cybersecurity operations.

## Splunk

Splunk is a powerful platform for collecting, indexing, and analyzing machine-generated data in real time. It is widely used in cybersecurity for its ability to process logs, events, and telemetry data to detect anomalies and threats. Splunk’s architecture is based on three primary components:

1. **Forwarders**: Collect data from various sources and send it to the Splunk indexers.
2. **Indexers**: Store and index the data for fast retrieval during searches.
3. **Search Heads**: Provide an interface for querying and visualizing the indexed data.

Key Features of Splunk in Cybersecurity:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual patterns in network traffic and system logs.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Provides rich visualizations for monitoring security events.
- **Search Processing Language (SPL)**: Allows users to query and analyze data with precision using a Splunk-centric query language.
- **Integration with SIEMs**: Splunk plays a key role in SIEM by aggregating and analyzing security data.

In this context, Splunk enables Teleseer to overlay event data on its timelines and correlate it with network telemetry, providing analysts with deeper insights.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine often used in cybersecurity to efficiently store, search, and analyze vast amounts of log data from various systems across a network, allowing security analysts to quickly identify potential threats and investigate security incidents by looking for patterns and anomalies in real-time; making it a valuable tool for threat hunting and incident response due to its fast querying capabilities and ability to handle large data volumes.

Key features of Elasticsearch include:

  * **Centralized data storage**:  Elasticsearch acts as a central repository for security logs from diverse sources like network devices, servers, applications, and endpoints, enabling a holistic view of system activity. 
    
  * **Real-time analysis**:  Its fast search functionality allows security analysts to query large datasets in near real-time to identify suspicious activity as it occurs. 
    
  * **Pattern detection**: By analyzing log data, Elasticsearch can identify unusual patterns or anomalies that might indicate a potential cyber attack. 

  * **Threat hunting**:  Security teams can proactively search for potential threats by querying Elasticsearch for specific indicators of compromise (IOCs). 
    
  * **Incident response**: When a security incident occurs, Elasticsearch can be used to rapidly investigate the details of the attack by quickly searching through relevant log data. 

Elasticsearch is commonly used as part of the "*ELK Stack*", which includes **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana**. Together, these tools form a powerful suite for log management and analytics:

* **Elasticsearch**: The core search and analytics engine that indexes and queries data.
* **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to Elasticsearch.
* **Kibana**: A visualization tool that provides dashboards and analytics for data stored in Elasticsearch.

## Scope

The scope of this document, and the described interoperability test are focused on Teleseer's ability to export data to, and import data from, Splunk and Elasticsearch.  These capabilities are provided by Teleseer's connector logic, which are interfaces for making Teleseer work with other analyst tools and applications.

The interoperability test also tested Teleseer's core capabilities and features to ensure they were not negatively impacted by the SIEM integrations.
